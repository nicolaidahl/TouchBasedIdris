% Mention somewhere: Low memorability with gestures (p 141) It’s probably not a good idea for us to
% invent too many new gestures, as they are hard to discover and people don’t
% remember them Alternatively gestures can be a power user functionality that
% makes it faster to work with the app. We should put in standard single tap
% ways of doing things in any case (p. 143)
