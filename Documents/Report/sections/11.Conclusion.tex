\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}

In this report we have analyzed a wide range of the state-of-the-art touch-based, visual, and structured
editors. We have given an overview of general pitfalls from these solutions and used these to form a set of goals and requirements. 

Next we performed two design iterations, one that was usability tested using
mock-ups and one that was tested through an iPad prototype. These tests
indicated that visual elements can successfully be used to indicate program structure in our editor, that
a solid input flow with auto completion is paramount to minimizing the use of
the virtual keyboard, and that representing data declarations in the standard
way we know from intuitionistic logic is difficult for novice Idris users to
understand.

By taking all issues, recommendations, features, goals as well as general usability into account, we proposed a new design along with a plan for further usability testing and development.

Finally, we concluded that our new design incorporates all of our requirements stated in
Section~\ref{subsec:FunctionalRequirements} and
\ref{sec:usability_requirements}, and that that we are convinced that further development
of the prototype will results in the fulfillment of all the goals stated in
Section \ref{sec:Goals}.
