\section{Analysis of Visual and Touch Based Solutions}
\label{sec:Analysis}

The amount of touch-based and/or visual programming languages and editors that have already been developed is quite large as can be seen from Eric Hosick's list.\,\cite{hosick2014} For this very reason it was important for us to define which types of existing solutions that are of interest to us.

There has been plenty of research on how to make programming languages that are usable for non programmers\todo{Refs: Pane et al., A. Myers, Green}, but given the fact that the field of dependent types is still in its early development phase \todo{ref?}, we can limit our target group to expert programmers making introductory languages for novice developers irrelevant.
