Important notes on constraining factors
  - We had the choice between working with the low level Idris abstract syntax or the high level one. We decided to translate the JSON coming from the network to and from the high level abstract syntax of Idris, as the alternative would require us to learn a great deal more about type theory. The trade off is that the high level syntax relies on multiple Haskell libraries for various parts of the implementation. This means that weâ€™ve had to learn what all these dependencies meant without really getting any benefit from it. Example: CheapSkate
  - Writing a JSON parser is a tedious task and one that should be left to standard or third party libraries. This was done on the Haskell side of the network implementation, but on the Objective-C side, we ran into an unexpected problem. The parser libraries available do not work well with
