\subsection{Core Questions}
In this project we set out with two core questions:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item How can a more visual representation of the language improve the usability of touch-based programming?
	\item How can the greater tool-support of Idris improve touch-based programming?
\end{enumerate}

Even though we have come closer to an answer to these questions, there is still
a long way to go before one can jump to conclusions. We do, however, have an
initial indication that our program structure is easily readable but that the
way we present data declarations is not the most ideal for programmers with
only little experience in dependently typed programs\,\todo{ref to section}. On the other hand, we
